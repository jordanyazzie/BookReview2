  <h2> Voices: The Final Hours of Joan of Arc <br> by David Elliott </h2>

  <p class="font-weight-bold">Author David Elliott explores how Joan of Arc changed the course of history and remains a
    figure of fascination centuries after her extraordinary life and death.</p>

  <p>Told through medieval poetic forms and in the voices of the people and objects in Joan of Arcâ€™s life, (including
    her family and even the trees, clothes, cows, and candles of her childhood). Along the way it explores issues such
    as gender, misogyny, and the peril of speaking truth to power. Before Joan of Arc became a saint, she was a girl
    inspired. It is that girl we come to know in Voices.</p>
