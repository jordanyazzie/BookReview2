  <h2>Long Live the Tribe of Fatherless Girls <br> by T Kira Madden (Goodreads Author)</h2>

  <p class="font-weight-bold">“Frank and funny and powerful and surprising. An utterly gorgeous debut.”-Lauren Groff</p>

  <p>Acclaimed literary essayist T Kira Madden's raw and redemptive debut memoir is about coming of age and reckoning
    with desire as a queer, biracial teenager amidst the fierce contradictions of Boca Raton, Florida, a place where
    she found cult-like privilege, shocking racial disparities, rampant white-collar crime, and powerfully destructive
    standards of beauty hiding in plain sight.</p>

  <p>As a child, Madden lived a life of extravagance, from her exclusive private school to her equestrian trophies and
    designer shoe-brand name. But under the surface was a wild instability. The only child of parents continually
    battling drug and alcohol addictions, Madden confronted her environment alone. Facing a culture of assault and
    objectification, she found lifelines in the desperately loving friendships of fatherless girls.</p>

  <p>With unflinching honesty and lyrical prose, spanning from 1960s Hawai'i to the present-day struggle of a young
    woman mourning the loss of a father while unearthing truths that reframe her reality, Long Live the Tribe of
    Fatherless Girls is equal parts eulogy and love letter. It's a story about trauma and forgiveness, about families
    of blood and affinity, both lost and found, unmade and rebuilt, crooked and beautiful. </p>
